#### Micro-frontends and composable frontend architectures

> Similar concept as micro-services, micro-frontends are the result of aplying "Separation of Concerns" (business logic from GUI logic) principles, breaking down, and or decoupling large user interfaces into smaller, more manageable and independently deployable pieces, with benefits that range from simplified coding and development workflows to future-proofing, and project organization.<br />

#### Cascade Layers:

> Don't let specificity force you into strict selector conventions. Cascade Layers allow us to manage specificity without resorting to naming hacks or the `!important` flag.<br />

#### Style with Stateful, Semantic Selectors
  
> If a state is important enough to indicate visually, it's probably important enough to expose to assistive technologies. Building with accessible semantics from the get-go can give you expressive, meaningful style hooks for free.<br />

#### Using CSS to Enforce Accessibility

> ARIA brings a lot to the table that HTML does not, such as complex widgets and state information that HTML does not have natively.<br />

#### The details and summary elements, again

> HTML’s `<details>` and `<summary>` elements can be used to create native disclosure widgets - an expand/collapse widget where more information or interactive controls related to a topic (identified via the subtree content of the `<summary>`, or text preceding the disclosure widget) can be found.<br />

#### W3C Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) 1.3: Specification 5:3 Categorization of Roles

> To support the current user scenario, this specification categorizes roles that define user interface widgets (sliders, tree controls, etc.) and those that define page structure (sections, navigation, etc.). Note that some assistive technologies provide special modes of interaction for regions marked with role application or document.<br />

#### Represent State with HTML Attributes, Not Class Names

> Representing an element’s state using HTML attributes and styling the element using the CSS attribute selector.<br />

#### Navigation: You Are Here

> You-are-here navigation consists of signs that help orient website visitors as they explore the site. Many websites need stronger location indicators.<br />
